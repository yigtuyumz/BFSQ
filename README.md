## Did you know that the Biggest Fucking SQuare in the World is [Xinghai Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xinghai_Square) ?

### Developing the Project
- For now, each .c file represents an idea. Thus, they can change at anytime.
- Use the git system with cautious.
- Each commit message can sum up a lot. Commit messages are so useful to get the point properly without wasting any time.
- Do not over commit. What I mean is, when you change a file, commit it as soon as you can.
- Semantic commits are welcome.
- Log the things that you made!! (For more info, please look at `Logging the Progress' section)

### Logging the Progress
- While developing this project, please log each step that you made, with ```./log.sh "log message"```.
- It will create dev.log file in cwd if it not exists.
- The log format is:
```
[username@hostname - timestamp] 'log message'
```
